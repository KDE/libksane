TODO list to be more KDE compliant:

* Internationalization : tr() ==> i18n().
* Internationalization : check if libsane strings are i18n using gettext and handle it properlly.
* API : use reference instead pointers when it's possible.
* Doc : add API documentation using Doxygen forms.
* QDialog => Kdialog. fix dialog buttons handling.

TODO list of new features:

* Added methods to get strings info from scanner device to be hosted later in
  image metadata (make, model, dpi, color mode, etc)
* Progressive final scan: scan can provide huge image especially in 16 bits color depth.
  Send image data on host application by blog, not the whole image.
